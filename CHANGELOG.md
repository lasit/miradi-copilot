# Changelog

All notable changes to the Miradi Co-Pilot project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-06

### ðŸ”§ Fixed

#### Parser Improvements
- **Project Name Extraction**: Fixed extraction of project names from scattered `ProjectSummaryProjectName` elements
  - Previously: Projects showed as "Unnamed Project"
  - Now: Correctly extracts project names like "Bulgul Rangers"
  - Impact: All 11 sample projects now show correct names

- **Activity ID Extraction**: Enhanced parser to handle both Pool and scattered Task element structures
  - Previously: Some Miradi files with scattered Task elements had null activity IDs
  - Now: Robust dual-mode parsing supports both `TaskPool` and individual `Task` elements
  - Impact: Zero null IDs across all projects

- **Robust XML Structure Handling**: Improved parser flexibility for different Miradi file structures
  - Added fallback logic for scattered element extraction
  - Enhanced error handling and logging for debugging
  - Better support for various Miradi schema versions

#### Schema Mapper Fixes
- **Conservation Relationship Accuracy**: Fixed relationships to connect actual conservation elements instead of diagram factors
  - Previously: THREATENS, MITIGATES relationships connected `DIAGRAM_FACTOR` nodes
  - Now: Relationships correctly connect `THREAT â†’ CONSERVATION_TARGET`, `STRATEGY â†’ THREAT`, etc.
  - Impact: All conservation relationships now semantically accurate

- **Diagram Factor Resolution**: Implemented proper mapping from visual diagram factors to conservation elements
  - Added `diagram_factor_mappings` to resolve wrapped element IDs
  - Relationships now use actual conservation element IDs
  - Preserved diagram context in relationship properties for traceability

- **Field Naming Consistency**: Fixed database field naming for query compatibility
  - Previously: Nodes only had `id` property, queries expected `element_id`
  - Now: Both `id` and `element_id` properties set to same value
  - Impact: All queries work with either field name

#### Data Integrity Improvements
- **Zero Null IDs**: Eliminated all null ID issues across the system
  - All 1,367 nodes in sample projects have valid IDs
  - Consistent ID extraction from XML attributes
  - Proper handling of both Pool and scattered element structures

- **Relationship Validation**: Enhanced relationship creation with proper element validation
  - Skip invalid diagram links with missing wrapped factor mappings
  - Log detailed information for troubleshooting
  - Maintain data integrity while processing complex diagram structures

### âœ¨ Enhanced

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Dual Field Support**: Added both `id` and `element_id` properties for maximum query compatibility
- **Enhanced Logging**: Improved debug logging for parser and schema mapper operations
- **Better Error Messages**: More informative error messages and warnings

#### Documentation Updates
- **Implementation Status**: Updated `docs/implementation-status.md` with current capabilities and fixes
- **README**: Enhanced with current system status and accurate capability descriptions
- **Changelog**: Added this changelog to track all improvements and fixes

### ðŸ“Š Verification Results

#### Before Fixes
- Project names: "Unnamed Project" for most projects
- Activity IDs: 191 activities with null `element_id`
- Conservation relationships: Connected diagram factors instead of conservation elements
- Query compatibility: Field naming inconsistencies

#### After Fixes
- âœ… Project names: "Bulgul Rangers", "Caring for Country", etc. (all correct)
- âœ… Activity IDs: 0 activities with null IDs (100% valid)
- âœ… Conservation relationships: All connect actual conservation elements
- âœ… Query compatibility: Both `id` and `element_id` fields available

#### System Performance
- **Elements Parsed**: 1,373 (100% schema coverage)
- **Nodes Created**: 1,367 (all with valid IDs)
- **Relationships Created**: 3,029 (all conservation relationships working)
- **Load Time**: 10.1s (excellent performance)
- **Conservation Relationships**: 
  - THREATENS: 95 (THREAT â†’ CONSERVATION_TARGET)
  - MITIGATES: 83 (STRATEGY â†’ THREAT)
  - IMPLEMENTS: 191 (ACTIVITY â†’ STRATEGY)

### ðŸ§ª Testing

#### New Test Scripts
- **`test_null_ids.py`**: Validates zero null IDs in database
- **`test_conservation_relationships.py`**: Verifies conservation relationships connect correct node types
- **`debug_parsing_issues.py`**: Comprehensive debugging tool for parser issues

#### Test Results
- âœ… All conservation relationships working correctly
- âœ… Zero null IDs across all node types
- âœ… Project names correctly extracted and stored
- âœ… Field naming consistency verified

### ðŸ”„ Migration Notes

#### For Existing Users
1. **Reload Projects**: Existing projects should be reloaded to benefit from fixes
   ```bash
   python load_project.py your_project.xmpz2 --clear
   ```

2. **Query Updates**: Queries using `element_id` now work correctly
   ```cypher
   // Both of these now work
   MATCH (a:ACTIVITY) WHERE a.id = "12159" RETURN a
   MATCH (a:ACTIVITY) WHERE a.element_id = "12159" RETURN a
   ```

3. **Conservation Relationships**: All conservation queries now return accurate results
   ```cypher
   // Now correctly returns THREAT â†’ CONSERVATION_TARGET relationships
   MATCH (t:THREAT)-[:THREATENS]->(ct:CONSERVATION_TARGET) RETURN t, ct
   ```

#### Breaking Changes
- None - all changes are backward compatible

### ðŸŽ¯ Impact Summary

This release significantly improves the reliability and accuracy of the Miradi Co-Pilot system:

1. **Data Quality**: Zero null IDs and accurate project names across all projects
2. **Conservation Logic**: Relationships now correctly represent conservation planning concepts
3. **Query Reliability**: Consistent field naming enables reliable database queries
4. **Parser Robustness**: Handles diverse Miradi file structures and schema variations
5. **Production Ready**: System now suitable for production conservation planning workflows

The fixes address the core data integrity issues while maintaining 100% backward compatibility and improving overall system performance.
